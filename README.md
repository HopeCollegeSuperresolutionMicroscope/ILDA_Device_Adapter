# ILDA_Device_Adapter
Device Adapter for micromanager that should interface with Custom PCB for ILDA setups

This project attempts to interface with a custom PCB to control ILDA entertainment lasers through micromanager for more scientific applications.

## Note
This project should be reorganized for external contributors.  Code is documented here in its working form as a means of transparent documentation.  **Justin Hanselman (3/25/18)**
